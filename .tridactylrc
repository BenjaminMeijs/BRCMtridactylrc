" | SITE SPECIFIC SETTINGS
" Don't run Tridactyl on some web sites because it doesn't work well, or
" because the web site has its own keybindings.

autocmd DocStart www.youtube.com/watch mode ignore

" | UI

" Defaults to 300ms but I'm a 'move fast and close the wrong tabs' kinda chap
set hintdelay 100

"Set the color mode to something nice.
colorscheme shydactyl 

" Just use a blank page for new tab. It would be nicer to use the standard
" Firefox homepage, but Tridactyl doesn't support this yet.
set newtab about:blank





" | EDITOR
" Use neovim for editor.

" | RC SETUP
" vim: filetype=vim

" This wipes all existing settings. This means that if a setting in this file
" is removed, then it will return to default. In other words, this file serves
" as an enforced single point of truth for Tridactyl's configuration.
